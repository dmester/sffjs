DESCRIPTION

This is a JavaScript library for string, date and number formatting. Formatting 
is done with format strings and is almost completely compatible with the 
String.Format method in Microsoft .NET Framework.

stringformat.js      - Compressed and obfuscated, to be used in production.
stringformat.src.js  - Commented source file for your reference.
test.html            - Test page that performs unit tests on the library.
